AI-Facts-Verification

📌 Project Description

AI-Facts-Verification is an open-source project designed to support fact verification using AI. The goal is to create a system that labels content credibility in a neutral and educational manner, empowering users to critically analyze information rather than relying on imposed conclusions.

🛠 How It Works?

✅ AI analyzes content and provides contextual information rather than absolute judgments.
✅ The system assigns credibility scores on a scale of 1-100 based on data validation.
✅ Does not block content but highlights potential inconsistencies, biases, and manipulations.
✅ Can be integrated as a browser extension, API, standalone platform, or mobile application.

1. AI Content Verification Approach

AI-Facts-Verification applies a multi-layered approach to assess content credibility, analyzing:

Source reliability – Verifying content against trusted fact-checking and academic databases.

Logical consistency – Evaluating coherence, contradictions, and flawed reasoning.

Manipulation detection – Identifying emotional triggers, misinformation tactics, and propaganda.

Cross-referencing facts – Comparing claims with established factual records.

Historical analysis – Recognizing patterns of previously debunked claims.

2. AI Credibility Scoring System

The AI system assigns a credibility score from 1 to 100, categorized as:

High credibility (80-100): Well-researched content with multiple verified sources.

Moderate credibility (50-79): Some supporting sources but potential minor inconsistencies.

Low credibility (1-49): Few/no sources, high manipulation risk, or misleading claims.

Unknown (0): Insufficient data to assess credibility.

3. AI Processing Pipeline

1️⃣ Text Extraction – Content is gathered from web pages, uploaded documents, or user inputs.
2️⃣ Metadata Verification – AI assesses timestamps, authorship, and source history.
3️⃣ Semantic & Sentiment Analysis – Detects emotionally charged language, bias, and misleading claims.
4️⃣ Fact-Checking & Cross-Validation – AI compares content against fact-checking repositories.
5️⃣ Pattern Recognition – Identifies known misinformation structures, propaganda techniques, and deepfakes.
6️⃣ Final Credibility Score Assignment – AI generates a report with a credibility score and recommendations.

4. AI Algorithms & Technologies

The system incorporates:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Enables AI to interpret and understand textual content.

Machine Learning (ML) Classifiers – Identifies misinformation patterns using supervised and unsupervised learning.

Neural Networks for Contextual Analysis – Detects relationships between claims and historical credibility.

Sentiment Analysis – Evaluates tone, emotional manipulation, and rhetoric bias.

Knowledge Graphs – Maps interconnections between data sources to improve verification.

Deepfake Detection Models – Recognizes AI-generated content, manipulated images, and videos.

5. Implementation Options

🔹 Browser Extension – Real-time content credibility analysis while browsing.🔹 API Integration – Websites and social media platforms can query AI for credibility scoring.🔹 Standalone Web Platform – Users can paste text or links for AI-powered verification.🔹 Mobile Application – On-the-go fact-checking for personal and professional use.

6. Data Sources & Fact-Checking Methods

✅ Fact-checking databases – AI references PolitiFact, Snopes, academic research, and public datasets.
✅ Blockchain for Data Integrity – Ensures transparency and prevents tampering of credibility results.
✅ Community Reporting System – Allows users to flag misleading content for review.
✅ Multi-language Support – AI adapts credibility analysis to different languages and cultural contexts.

7. Future Development Roadmap

✅ Phase 1: Develop an initial prototype as a browser extension.
✅ Phase 2: Expand the AI dataset and improve credibility analysis accuracy.
✅ Phase 3: Deploy API for real-time verification across platforms.
✅ Phase 4: Enable community-driven improvements and open-source collaboration.
✅ Phase 5: Implement advanced AI for deepfake detection and real-time misinformation tracking.
✅ Phase 6: AI-powered media forensics and real-time credibility scoring automation.
